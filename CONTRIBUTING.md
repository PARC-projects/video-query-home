## How to contribute to the Video Query project

This project comprises separate repositories for the front end, the API, and the Algorithms back end.
If you know your issue is specific to one of these repositories, please address it from there:

- [Video Query Client issues](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-client-web/issues)
- [Video Query API issues](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-api/issues)
- [Video Query Algorithms issues](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-algorithms/issues)

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Video Query Home Issues](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-home/issues), and as appropriate, 
[Video Query Client issues](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-client-web/issues), 
[Video Query API issues](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-api/issues), and
[Video Query Algorithms issues](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-algorithms/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
[open a new one](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-home/issues).
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample**
demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Video Query in the [Issues](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-home/issues).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change as an Issue in the specific repository where it would be added. 
* It is best you don't start any development until the change has been reviewed by the team and approved first.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Are you ready to submit a PR?**

Please send a GitHub Pull Request in the appropriate repository 
([Client](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-client-web/pulls), 
[API](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-api/pulls), or 
[Algorithms](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-algorithms/pulls)) with a clear list of
what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)).
Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes
should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
